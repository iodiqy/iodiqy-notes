- Sepsis patient should have organ dysfunction.

## Identify the cause
- Thorough exam
- Blood cultures
- UA & urine culture
- Other relevant cultures
- Chest X-ray
- Consider abdominal imaging (CT vs US)

## Identify complications
- CBC - anemia, thrombocytopenia
- DIC panel (e.g. INR, aPTT, fibrinogen) - DIC
- Metabolic panel - AKI, ↑ AG metabolic acidosis
- Lactate - Systemic hypoperfusion
- LFTs - ischemic hepatitis, hyperbilirubinemia
- ABG - Quantify $PO_2$ , identify ↑ $PCO_2$ , assess pH
- Chest X-ray - Pulmonary edema (e.g. non cardiogenic ARDS, as well as cardiogenic)
- Troponin - type 2 MI
- ECG - ischemia, arrythmias
- Echo - sepsis induced cardiomyopathy

## Treatment 
- ABCs (i.e. ensure pulse and respirations)
	- Restore hemodynamics
		- IV fluid boluses
			- Crystaloid fluid rather than colloids.
			- Balanced solutions (e.g. LR) > "Normal" saline
			- General guideline: 30mL/kg within the first 3 hrs
- Pressors (if fluids insufficient)
	- Norepinephrine first choice in septic shock
	- Vasopressin, epinephrine, dopamine, dobutamine, and phenylephrine are all potentially reasonable as a second med to add, depending on circumstances.
>[!tip] Epinephrine vs dopamine, dobutamine
>In older patients with a history of heart failure better dopamine and dobutamine
- Treat the underlying infection
	- Broad spectrum antibiotics (<1 hr vs. ASAP (As soon as possible)?)
	- Source control (e.g. drain abscess, d/c potentially infected line)

## Signs of adequate resuscitation
- MAP ≥ 65 mmHg
- Urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h
- Normalized mental status
- Improving lactate
- Variety of dynamic measures of hemodynamics in mechanically ventilated patients
